## About Me

![EzioRuan](/images/batman.png)

Hello, world!

I am EzioRuan


I have always struggled to write about myself, so I'll just list here some

- I got my first computer in 2002. It cost $1011 and it had a 1.7G Mhz CPU, 256 MB of RAM, I didn't plan to do much (any) programming on it.
- I studied CS in high-school, but I didn't really think I'd end up as a programmer. Programming felt like something quite boring when I was a kid.
- I am a big comic book fan. Batman is my favorite superhero.
- I used to be a big sports fan, and I like to play football.

You can learn way more about me from:

- the articles I wrote here and elsewhere.
